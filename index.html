                    When I was a kid, I started my dream of becoming a doctor with the goal of helping our society. But as the reality of life hit me, I gave up and thought of the second thing that I am good at. Programming has been my interest and one of the areas in which I excel. Back in high school, I was able to follow the steps of my teacher from HTML and CSS,  C++, to Java, and be able to understand it very well. This has become my inspiration to pursue computers more as I can be a help to our society still.

                    When I graduated in senior high school, I decided to study Python by myself and with the resources available on the internet. I was able to land my first job as a programmer and had to study Javascript, Node js, databases, and Python (specifically, machine learning). I have learned programming from scratch and I am willing to expand my expertise and knowledge.
